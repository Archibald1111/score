Factorial analysis of adjustments https://papa-score.com/
Based on the correct analysis of which football matches. The set is pretty standard:

Motivation. Difference in motivation;
Strength (class and game form);
composition optimization;
style of play (at home, away, against strong, weak and equal opponents);
timing (density, complexity, transmission range);
Face-to-face encounters (main, comfortable, and uncomfortable opponents).
Coaches, weather, pitch quality, small motivators, club birthdays, city days, manager births, etc.

Agree, not everything in this set of objective factors can come from statistics. Motivation can be calculated by the tournament. But for this you need experience. The class might not match the current location in the table. It comes mainly from the club's budget, the transfer fee of the team, the ambitions and tasks of the management. Game form cannot always be objectively assessed from statistics. It helps more to see matches or ratings. There are special services to follow the respective teams, and for the most unpopular leagues you have to use twitter or different profiles, often the regional sports press. In general, this is a whole kitchen. While compositions are one of the biggest and most important factors, they cannot be tracked by popular statistical portals. Playstyles vary from game to game, depending on the complexity of the opponent and the location of the game - this is a big separate layer for analysis. Here, the main basis will be the tracking of matches and visual impressions. A calendar with special experience can be evaluated by "Mayskor". Face-to-face encounters don't matter much, especially when it comes to 2-3+ year fights. Here it is necessary to mention only the continuous trends.

This set of factors is considered by professionals. Statistics are only used as an auxiliary factor. The odds are only used to compare the odds calculations of the bookmakers themselves, nothing more. This is not an analysis factor.
